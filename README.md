# Credit Risk Capital Estimation using Rating Transitions and Monte Carlo Simulation

## 1. Problem Statement: How Much Capital Should a Bank Hold Against Credit Risk?

Credit risk is the potential for a borrower to default or experience a downgrade in credit quality. For banks and financial institutions, failing to properly account for this risk can lead to significant losses and regulatory issues.

Under frameworks such as **Basel III** and **ICAAP**, institutions are required to calculate:
- **Expected Loss (EL)** ‚Äì the average credit loss over a period
- **Unexpected Loss (UL)** ‚Äì the potential deviation from the expected loss
- **Economic Capital** ‚Äì the capital needed to absorb losses with a high confidence level (e.g., 99%)

The key question:
> **How much capital should the institution reserve to remain solvent under plausible worst-case scenarios?**

## 2. Methodology: Why This Approach?

We address the problem by modeling credit rating migrations as a **Markov process**, where each borrower's rating can change based on historical transition probabilities. This is a well-established method in credit risk modeling, aligning with industry practices and data availability.

Key components of our approach:
- **Transition Matrix** from Moody‚Äôs to capture rating dynamics
- **Default Probabilities (PD)** and **Recovery Rates** based on internal assumptions
- **Exposure at Default (EAD)** of $1 million per asset
- **Monte Carlo Simulation** with 1,000 iterations to capture portfolio loss variability

This combination allows us to:
- Simulate future credit rating paths
- Estimate portfolio loss distribution
- Calculate **Credit Value-at-Risk (VaR)** at 99% and 99.9% levels
- Determine the **capital buffer** required to absorb those losses

### ‚û§ Input Ratings & Assumptions

| Rating | PD     | Recovery Rate |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| A      | 0.00   | 100%           |
| B      | 0.10   | 90%            |
| C      | 0.45   | 80%            |
| D      | 0.80   | 75%            |
| E      | 1.00   | 70%            |

Transition matrix used (simplified from Moody‚Äôs historical data):

| From \ To | A      | B      | C      | D      | E      |
|-----------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| A         | 0.923  | 0.076  | 0.001  | 0.000  | 0.000  |
| B         | 0.024  | 0.970  | 0.005  | 0.001  | 0.000  |
| C         | 0.001  | 0.004  | 0.929  | 0.063  | 0.003  |
| D         | 0.000  | 0.001  | 0.069  | 0.909  | 0.021  |
| E         | 0.000  | 0.000  | 0.027  | 0.054  | 0.919  |

## 4. Conclusion: Key Takeaways

- **Rating transitions** provide a realistic model of credit migration risk.
- **Lower-rated assets (C, D, E)** account for the majority of credit loss and volatility.
- Even though the **expected loss** is ~64M, institutions should hold **at least $1.5M in Economic Capital** for a 99% confidence level ‚Äî or more depending on regulatory requirements.
- The framework is flexible for stress testing, sensitivity analysis, and adapting to real portfolio data.
- This approach demonstrates not only technical proficiency with modeling and simulation, but also awareness of **real-world regulatory implications**.
